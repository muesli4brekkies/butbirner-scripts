Scripts for playing BitBurner

Copy lib.js and rset.js into your home, run rset.js and watch the sparks fly!

* ./rset.js launches lib.js with enough ram to bootstrap
* lib.js does the rest
* ./rset.js <any_argument> will kill everything.
* All files except for lib and rset are temporary

Requires singularity. All other node mehcanics should be guarded and not throw errors
