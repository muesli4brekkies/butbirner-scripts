Scripts for playing BitBurner

Copy func.js and rset.js into your home, run rset.js and watch the sparks fly!

* ./rset.js launches func.js with enough ram to bootstrap
* func.js does the rest
* ./rset.js <any_argument> will kill everything.
* All files except for func and rset are temporary
* solveallcontracts being missing is a hint for you to put one there 

Requires singularity. All other node mehcanics should be guarded and not throw errors
