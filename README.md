Scripts for playing BitBurner

Copy func.js and rset.js into your home, ./rset.js and watch the sparks fly!

* ./rset.js kills everything and restarts
* ./rset.js <any_argument> will kill everything.
* All files except for func and rset are temporary
* solveallcontracts being missing is a hint for you to put one there 

Requires singularity.
